        <h1>Exercise: String: Find Longest Substring without Repetition</h1>
        <p>
            You are given an array of strings. <br> 
            For each string, you must find the longest substring in which characters are not repeated.
        </p>        
        <p>
            For example, the string "abccc" will produce the longest substring "ab" because the character c is repeated. <br />
            The string "abcabcdd" will produce the longest substring "abcd"; therefore, the length of the substring is 4.<br />
            The string "ccccc" will produce the longest substring "c"; therefore, the length of the substring is 1.<br />
            The string "paakea" will produce the longest substring "ake"; therefore, the length of the substring is 3.<br />
            <u>Note:</u> "pake" would be a subsequence but not a longest substring.
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            let strArr : string[] = ["abcabcdd", "ccccc", "paakea"];
            return [4, 1, 3]
        </pre>
    
        <p>Time Complexity Expected: O(N) or better for each string processed</p>
        <p>Space Complexity Expected: O(N) or better for each string processed</p>

        <b>Solution:</b>
        <p>Time Complexity (to find each substring): O(N). The array is traversed once for each string.</p>
        <p>Space Complexity (to find each substring): O(N).</p>
        <p>
            <u>Explanation:</u><br />
            We use a hashmap to store the maximum count of characters for each character (key).<br />
            As we move from right to left throw the string, one character at the time, we update the hashmap.<br />
            If a character already exists in the hashmap, we increase the counter and move to the next character to the left.<br />
            The variable count is used as a pointer of position and counter.
