        <h1>Exercise: Math: FizzBuzz</h1>
        <p>
            We are provided with a number x and we are asked to iterate from 1 to x.<br>
            As we iterate, each number will be checkout.<br>
            If the number is divisible by 3, print the word "Fizz".<br>
            If the number is divisible by 5, print the word "Buzz".<br>
            If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print the word "FizzBuzz".<br>
            Else, just print the number as it is.<br>
            <u>Note:</u> The number x cannot be negative.
        </p>        
        <p>
            For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            let x : number = 16;
            1
            2
            Fizz
            4
            Buzz
            ...
            14
            FizzBuzz
            16
        </pre>
        <p>Time Complexity Expected: O(N)</p>

        <b>Solution:</b>
        <p>
            <u>Explanation:</u><br />
            To solve this issue, we are going to use the remainder (%) operator.<br>
            The remainder operator returns the remainder of two numbers.<br>
            It is useful when trying to figure out when a number is odd or even and restrictinv a value to a range.<br>
            In our case, we want to restrict a value to 3 and 5, 3, then 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that we switched the order in which we test the value by checking first if the value is divisible by 3 and 5.<br>
            This is done of purpose because we would never had that statement being true if we would check first if a number is divisible by 3 or by 5.<br>            
        </p>
        <p>
            It's always good to go over your code and check that it does the job correctly.<br>
